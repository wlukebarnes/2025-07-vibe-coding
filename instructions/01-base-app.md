# Build the base of an app

Make me a simple flask app (/backend) that serves a hello world index.html file (/frontend).
have the flask app load the env file in /backend.
have no other libraries in the requirements.txt but what i've mentioned, and uvicorn to run the app. Do not specify package versions. this goes in the /backend folder.
the app is in debug mode and listens on port 8000.

add a standard python .gitignore in the root workspace folder. In addition to the standard .gitignore, also apply each rule to the /backend folder too, specifically for **pycache**, .env, and .venv. my venv is a folder called .venv.

don't worry about setting up virtual environments, i will handle it.
