# Build the base of an app

Make me a simple FastAPI app (in the root of the project) that serves a hello world index.html file (in /frontend).
have the FastAPI app load the env file.
the app runs directly with FastAPI and listens on port 8000.

don't worry about setting up virtual environments or packages, i will handle it.
