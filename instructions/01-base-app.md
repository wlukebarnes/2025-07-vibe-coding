# Build the base of an app

Make me a simple flask app (in the root of the project) that serves a hello world index.html file (in /frontend).
have the flask app load the env file.
use uvicorn to run the app.
the app is in debug mode and listens on port 8000.

don't worry about setting up virtual environments or packages, i will handle it.
