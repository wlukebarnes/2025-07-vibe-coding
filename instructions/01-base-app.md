# Build the base of an app

Make me a simple flask app (in the root of the project) that serves a hello world index.html file (in /frontend).
have the flask app load the env file.
have no other libraries in the requirements.txt but what i've mentioned, and uvicorn to run the app. Do not specify package versions.
the app is in debug mode and listens on port 8000.

add a standard python .gitignore in the root workspace folder. specifically, .env, and .venv. my venv is a folder called .venv.

don't worry about setting up virtual environments, i will handle it.
