Make me a simple FastAPI app that serves a hello world index.html file.
have the flask app load the env file.
have no other libraries in the requirements.txt. Do not specify package versions. this goes in the /app folder.
the app is in debug mode and listens on port 8000.

add a standard python .gitignore in the root workspace folder. In addition to the standard .gitignore, also apply each rule to the /backend folder too, specifically for **pycache**, .env, and venv.

don't worry about virtual environments, I'll handle it
